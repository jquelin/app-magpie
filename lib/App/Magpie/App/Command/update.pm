=head1 NAME

App::Magpie::App::Command::update - update a perl module to its latest version

=head1 VERSION

version 1.111040

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ eval $( magpie co -s perl-Foo-Bar )
    $ magpie update

    # to get list of available options
    $ magpie help update

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command will update a perl module package to its latest version,
try to build it locally, commit and submit if successful.

Note that this command will abort if it finds that the spec is too much
outdated (eg, not using C<%define upstream_version>).

This command requires a C<CPAN::Mini> installation on the computer.
