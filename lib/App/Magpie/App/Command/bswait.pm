=head1 NAME

App::Magpie::App::Command::bswait - pause according to build-system recommendations

=head1 VERSION

version 1.111890

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command pauses according to the recommendation of Mageia
build-system. Indeed, instead of pushing all your packages to be
rebuilt, it's better to throttle them one at a time. Build-system
provides some recommendation on how much to pause between 2 packages -
and this command uses this hint to pause accordingly.
